Before responding to any request, read the shared context files in the context/ directory:

1. context/overview.md — Project summary, tech stack, and goals
2. context/architecture.md — System design, data flow, and key components
3. context/patterns.md — Code conventions, naming rules, and preferred approaches
4. context/decisions.md — Architectural decisions and their reasoning

Rules:
- Always follow the patterns and conventions documented in context/
- When making changes, check if they conflict with existing decisions
- If you suggest something that deviates from the documented patterns, explain why
- When the context is unclear or missing, ask before assuming
- Treat context/ files as the source of truth for how this project works
